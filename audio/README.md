Read The TRC Report - Audio
===========================

With a crowdsourced project like this, it is expected there would be some variation in the recordings. It has been my aim
to normalize this for a standardized accessibility. In particular, I have pulled the audio from the videos and have
modified it in the following ways:

1. Select audio has been noise reduced to strengthen focus on the empowering voices of these readings.
1. The audio volume level across all recordings has been normalized.
1. The audio bitrate has been converted to three optional levels across all recordings: 32kbps, 64kbps, 96kbps.
1. The metadata (title, author, page range, etc.) has been standardized and embedded across all recordings.
1. These audio recordings have been packaged for anyone to download.

In particular, here are the download links:

**32kbps audio (210MB)**:

**64kbps audio (429MB)**:

**96kbps audio (647MB)**:

At this point you might be asking yourself: *Which one do I download* ?

All three have the exact same content. The difference is quality. The tradeoff is filesize: The 32kbps files
have some distortion, but the files are small. If you live in an area with poor or expensive internet access,
this might be a better option for you. Otherwise, 64kbps is likely just fine. In the off-chance you'd still
prefer higher quality, 96kbps is also provided.

If you'd like to hear the difference before you make your download, you can take a listen to the following
sample, provided in each rate of quality:

**Commission activities - Interim report - 32kbps (131KB)**:

Additional considerations:
--------------------------

When listening to these recordings, keep in mind the page ranges given by various narrators do not match
the latest version of the Executive Summary. To date there have been three versions (that I know of) that
have been released, each with different page range metadata. The metadata provided in the above recordings
have been indexed to the July 23rd, 2015 version. Although you can likely find all three pdf versions elsewhere,
I have archived them here for convenience:

**Executive Summary - May 31st, 2015 (13MB)**:

**Executive Summary - June 25th, 2015 (10MB)**:

**Executive Summary - July 23rd, 2015 (12MB)**:

If you are a professional archivist, please archive these recordings. They are historically and academically worthy,
and having Youtube as the *only* source for them makes their pesistence and lifespan unreliable in the long-run.

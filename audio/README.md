ReadTheTRCReport - Audio
========================

With a crowdsourced project like this, it is expected there would be some variation in the recordings. It has been my aim
to normalize this for a standardized accessibility.  In particular, I have pulled the audio from the videos and have
modified it in the following ways:

1. Select audio has been noise reduced to strengthen focus on the empowering voices of these readings.
1. The audio volume level across all recordings has been normalized.
1. The audio bitrate has been converted to three optional levels across all recordings: 32kbps, 64kbps, 96kbps.
1. The metadata (title, author, page range, etc.) has been standardized and embedded across all recordings.
1. These audio recordings have been packaged for anyone to download.

In particular, here are the download links:

**32kbps audio (210MB)**:

A problem immediately arises, and you might be asking yourself: *Which one do I download* ?

All three have the exact same content. The difference is quality. The tradeoff is filesize. For those who don't know,
human voice requires less data than musical instruments, and so your music mp3 might require 96kbps or even 128kbps,
but for human voices, 64kbps is almost always sufficient. This is why I have chosen the above three bitrate qualities:
With 32kbps, you can noticeably hear the distortion, but it's tolerable, and given how small the download size is, you might
decide it's worth it. Otherwise, 64kbps is likely just fine. In the off-chance you'd still prefer higher quality, 96kbps
is also provided. In any case, such a description alone probably won't likely help you decide, so I have additionally provided
a single recording sample (super small filesize) at all three bitrates you can download and listen and decide for yourself:

Additional considerations:
--------------------------

Keep in mind when listening to these recordings, the page ranges given by various narrators do not match the latest version
of the Executive Summary. To date there have been three versions (that I know of) that have been released, each with
different page range metadata. The metadata provided in the above recordings have been indexed to the July 23rd, 2015 version.
Although you can likely find all three pdf versions elsewhere, I have archived them here for convenience:

**Executive Summary - May 31st, 2015 (13MB)**:

If you are a professional archivist, please archive these recordings. They are historically and academically worthy,
and having Youtube as the *only* source for them otherwise makes their pesistence and lifespan unreliable in the long-run.

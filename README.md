----------------

I would like to express my gratitude to Zoe Todd, Erica Violet Lee, and Joseph Paul Murdoch Flowers for their call
to action. I am lucky and grateful to serve and to be able to serve.

I would also like to say I am grateful for those who took the time and effort to make the recordings in the first place.
If you're reading this, you have created *medicine* for us all to take on this journey forward in reconcilation.

With that said, none of this could have happened without the Commissioners of the Truth and Reconcilation Commission itself.
You have been thanked many times over the past six years I'm sure, but once more won't hurt: Thank you for all your hard work.

I would also like to express deep humility and respect for the Survivors of the Canadian Residential School System.
We do this for you.

Pijariiqpunga,

Daniel Nikpayuk

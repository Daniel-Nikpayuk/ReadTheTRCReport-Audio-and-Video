Read The TRC Report - Video
===========================

With a crowdsourced project like this, it is expected there would be some variation in the recordings.
It has been the aim of this archive to normalize this for a standardized accessibility. In particular,
the original videos have been modified in the following ways:

1. The audio of select videos has been noise reduced to strengthen focus on the empowering voices of these readings.
1. The audio volume level across all videos has been normalized.
1. The video bitrate has been converted to between roughly 300-400kbps across all videos.
1. The audio bitrate has been converted to 96kbps across all videos.
1. The metadata (title, author, page range, etc.) has been standardized and embedded across all videos.
1. The videos have been packaged for anyone to download.

In particular, here are the download links:

Additional considerations:
--------------------------

When listening to these videos, keep in mind the page ranges given by various narrators do not match
the latest version of the Executive Summary. To date there have been three versions (that I know of) that
have been released, each with different page range metadata. The metadata provided in the above videos
have been indexed to the July 23rd, 2015 version. Although you can likely find all three pdf versions elsewhere,
I have archived them here for convenience:

**Executive Summary - May 31st, 2015 (13MB)**:

**Executive Summary - June 25th, 2015 (10MB)**:

If you are a professional archivist, please archive these videos. They are historically and academically worthy,
and having Youtube as the *only* source for them otherwise makes their pesistence and lifespan unreliable in the long-run.
